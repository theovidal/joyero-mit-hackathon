**Agentic AI to naturally and quickly prototype 3D models**

This repository contains my submission for the [MIT Global AI Hackathon 2025](https://www.globalaihackathon.com/), a 17-hours competition that took place on May 3rd to develop a solution based on AI on different subjects. This project is an answer to the following challenge: "Generative 3D Jewelry Design: From Prompt or Image to Printable Shape".
